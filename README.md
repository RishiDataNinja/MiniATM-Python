# 🏧 MiniATM – Python CLI Simulator

This is a mini ATM simulator project built using Python. It allows users to perform basic banking operations like creating a PIN, checking balance, changing the PIN, and withdrawing money — all through a command-line interface (CLI).

## 📌 Project Description

This project is designed for beginners who want to strengthen their Python fundamentals and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) skills. It simulates the logic of a real ATM system while running in a simple text-based interface.

✅ Core Features:
- Create and store a secure PIN  
- Change existing PIN with validation  
- Check account balance with PIN verification  
- Withdraw money with balance check  
- CLI-based menu for smooth user interaction  

## 🧠 Concepts Used:
- Python Classes and Objects (OOP)
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Encapsulation
- Function calling
- CLI interaction using `input()`
- Project structuring for beginners

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python atm_simulator.py
